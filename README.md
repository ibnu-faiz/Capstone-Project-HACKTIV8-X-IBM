### 🔍 Research Questions
1. How does sentiment distribution correlate with numerical ratings in Gojek app reviews?
2. Which specific app aspects (UI/UX, performance, payment, etc.) are most frequently mentioned in positive vs negative reviews?
3. How do user satisfaction trends change over time and across different app versions?
4. What insights can help Gojek improve user retention and overall satisfaction scores?
